# 🚀 RAG-Based Customer Support Assistant  
### Using LangGraph & Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed for customer support use cases.  
It retrieves relevant information from a PDF knowledge base and generates accurate, context-aware responses using a local LLM.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional chatbots:
- Provide generic responses  
- Fail for paraphrased queries  
- May hallucinate incorrect answers  

This system solves these issues by:
- Retrieving real information from documents  
- Generating grounded responses  
- Escalating uncertain queries to a human  

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📄 PDF-based knowledge retrieval  
- 🔍 Semantic search using embeddings  
- 🧠 Context-aware response generation  
- 🔄 Graph-based workflow using LangGraph  
- ⚖️ Decision-based routing (Answer / Escalate)  
- 👨‍💻 Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) escalation  
- 💻 Fully local setup (no API cost)

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Flow:

User → LangGraph → Retriever → LLM → Decision → Output / HITL

---

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Ingestion Phase
PDF → Loader → Chunking → Embeddings → ChromaDB

### Query Phase
User Query → Retriever → Context → LLM → Response → Decision

Decision → Answer / Escalation

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- LangChain  
- LangGraph  
- ChromaDB  
- Ollama (Mistral - Local LLM)  
- Sentence Transformers  

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Load PDF knowledge base  
2. Split text into chunks  
3. Convert chunks into embeddings  
4. Store in ChromaDB  
5. User submits query  
6. Retrieve relevant chunks  
7. Generate response using LLM  
8. Apply decision logic  
9. Answer or escalate to human  

---

## 🔀 Workflow (LangGraph)

Nodes:
- `process_node` → Retrieval + LLM  
- `output_node` → Decision + Output  

Flow:
process → output

---

## ⚖️ Decision Logic

The system escalates when:
- No relevant information found  
- Response contains "NOT_FOUND"  
- Response is too short  
- Context mismatch  

---

## 👨‍💻 Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

When confidence is low:
- System triggers escalation  
- Human provides response  
- Final answer returned

## 🧪 Example Queries

| Query | Output |
|------|-------|
| What is refund policy? | Answer |
| How to contact support? | Answer |
| Tell me about space rockets | Escalation |

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-support-assistant.git
cd rag-support-assistant
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
### 4. Start Ollama
ollama serve

### 5. Run Application
python main.py

---
## ⚠️ Notes

- Ensure Ollama is running before executing the script  
- First run may take time due to model loading  
- Uses local embeddings (no API required)
